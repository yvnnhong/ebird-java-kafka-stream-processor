============================================================

Generated: 2025-06-28 15:34:26

## Dataset Summary
Total synthetic observations: 1000
True anomalies (ground truth): 32
Normal observations: 968
Anomaly rate: 3.2%

## Detection Performance
True Positives: 31
False Positives: 0
True Negatives: 968
False Negatives: 1
Precision: 1.000
Recall: 0.969
F1-Score: 0.984

## Statistical Analysis
Normal observations - Mean: 5.94, Std: 2.00
Anomalous observations - Mean: 82.69, Std: 40.76
Detection multiplier range: 2.0x - 35.2x

## Technical Implementation
- Data Source: 20-year eBird historical data (2005-2024)
- Prediction Model: Polynomial regression (R² = 0.969)
- Synthetic Data: 2025 population predictions with seasonal patterns
- Detection Method: Z-score analysis (threshold > 3.0)
- Stream Processing: Apache Kafka with real-time processing
- Geographic Scope: San Diego County, California
- Target Species: Mourning Dove (Zenaida macroura)

## Conclusion
The regression-based synthetic data generation combined with Z-score anomaly detection
demonstrates effective real-time monitoring capabilities for ecological data streams.
The system achieved 100.0% precision and 96.9% recall in detecting
unusual bird population observations, suitable for production wildlife monitoring systems.
